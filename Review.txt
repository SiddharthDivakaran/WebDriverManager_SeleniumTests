1.There issue with the driver management as the driver  may not correlate to the Chrome version person is using this can be taken care by 
driver management system/dependency provided by bonigarcia and not need to explicitly provide platform detail.This also removes the need of keeping driver files in repository
2. Driver setup is provided within the test and this is same for all test which causes issue that is updating drier detail in every test class
and if other drivers are also required in this case segregating it into different package and calling driver using factory pattern
3.WebDriver provided wait should be used instead of halting the execution of program using thread
4.Locators are maintained within the test this makes it difficult to maintain thus segregating it and using page object pattern to maintain locators
5.After test run driver instance is never closed this again creates issue with memory
